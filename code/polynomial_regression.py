    ** Visualization of polynomial regressions of temperatures since 2018, by year, at a given location **

    The function takes as input: a CSV file containing temperature records (since 2018 and every 3 hours) from a port of the Geneva Lake, a path to store the graph as a PNG.
    The goal is to create a graph that approximates temperature variations throughout the year at a given port.
    This is to better visualize temperature variations from year to year.
